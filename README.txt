Photoshow allows to insert images in Wordrpess posts directly from Flickr, without having to pre-select them.

== Description ==

Photoshow allows to insert images in Wordrpess posts directly from Flickr, without having to pre-select them. All you need to do is pick your selection criteria, the amount of images to display, and the interval between each image, i.e. the amount of time that each image will remain visible before it is replaced by the next one.

The button that serves to insert Flickr images can be found above the blog editor, in the area of creation or editing of posts,  as well as in the dashboard.

**Features:**

*  Photoshow's main features are:
*  Automatic insertion of images associated to a specific blog content without the need for any previous selection.
*  Allows to show several images in the same space established during the insertion of Photoshow.
*  Brings dynamism to the blog.
*  Reduces the bandwidth since the images are hosted on Flickr.
